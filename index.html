        <div>I enjoy playing the piano. I started playing since I was five years old and I have played up to level 10 RCM (Royal Conservatory of Music). I have always preferred to play classical music since I find the complexity of the style enjoyable. </div>

        <div>I love picking up new languages. I did my grade 12 French in Switzerland and France and it was quite the amazing experience. I have taught myself the Korean and the Russian alphabet for fun. Lastly, I joined a club to learn ASL (American Sign Language).</div>

        <div>I enjoy programming and learning different ways to program. I love seeing the things I create come to life and how it could benefit another person. One of my biggest goals is to create a useful application that will be used to benefit many people.   </div>
